Idea:

- You are a fisherman. You catch fish and you can sell the fish for money or keep them in your aquarium. 
- You can pay to unlock other lakes and rivers to fish in
- you buy an aquarium to show off your fish 
- you can decorate each individual tank
- you can buy more rooms in your aquarium
- You can leave it on idle to catch fish over time or you can actively play and catch much better fish and faster
- you can pay to upgrade your gear to catch better fish
- Upgrades:
    - Heavier rod can catch bigger fish
    - better idle chances of catching a fish
    - more difficulty in the casting thing but higher chance of scoring better fish
    - better fish caught in idle
    - more inventory space
    - more holding pen space
- make inventory get full and you can upgrade the boat to be bigger so you can have more inventory room
- add a streak thing that increases chances of catching rarer fish if you have a higher streak
